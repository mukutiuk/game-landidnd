    The landing page is designed and developed using **JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and SASS** technologies,

    The game field is a 4 x 4 grid where each cell can be empty or contain a power of 2 starting from 2 (2, 4, 8, ..., 2048). Use the keyboard arrows to move the cells in your desired direction.

    During each move, all numbers will slide in the selected direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another number. When two equal cells collide, they will merge into a doubled number. Remember, a merged cell cannot be merged again during the same move.

    After each move, either a 2 or 4 will appear randomly in an empty cell. The probability of a 4 appearing is 10%. Keep playing and merging cells until you reach the coveted 2048 value in any cell to win the game!

    Let's begin the game and see if you can reach the ultimate goal of 2048. Good luck!
